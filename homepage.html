<div><span><p>Welcome to the Greenville Associates Solutions(MEDIA-PA) Fusion-Shell Homepage VO25.01. This is a sixth generation portal product which leverages opensource tools to deliver a working product on day one which can be operated by anyone without writing code, or you can start there, and have your staff add features using any tools they know. 
    This system fully integrates the top three CMS tools (Joomla, Drupal, and Wordpress) which together represent more than 95% of the Internet Market including nearly every vendor on earth who has Opensource Plugins.
    Furthermore it presents a unified Portal experience spanning all Opensource tools which allows you to mix and match pages in any combination, offering a world class environment which is significantly than just one tool on its own. If you try to install just Wordpress, just Joomla, or just Drupal on its own you may find yourself significantly below the level of your competition without significant investments in consulting to improve the media quality of your site.</p>
    <p>We dont alter the original products in any way except for how we integrate the MySQL database which we have taken time to integrate in with a common SSO environment.
    In other words we give one simple login which spans all tools in the package on a single Database server, with a very complex schema. It took us more than 10 years of engineering to accomplish this feat which is marvelous in itself. Its a major effort beyond the capabilities of a small business and lets your small business compete with World Class Competitition which include the largest Enterprises on Earth.</p>
    <p>FusionShell has more than 10K downloads and has versions for just public Internet, just Intranet Uses, or both. Furthermore our toolset allows you to extend to professional or open source accounting tools which you may not know you need. We think you will find.... as you set out on your Internet adventure that open tools will take you on the order of 3 years per system to master, and a collection of all 3 more than 10. You will thank us for starting with FusionShell first. Then decide what you like or dont like. The only issue with using our system is getting the databases for the CMS products installed properly. The rest is easy.
     </p><p>Because installation for business professionals is complicated, we recommend you invest in a cPanel server first which can be acquired directly from cPanel or via a major hosting provider such as CTS, Siteground, GoDaddy/Web.Com or Host Gator. We offer discounts to those that choose CTS and they can help you with distributed platforms which allow you to focus on your business. CTS has an advantage in that they are doing more than point Solutions   
    and support standalone and globally distributed version of our product. CTS and G/A are owned by the same investor base, and we work together on major initiatives.

<H3>Getting Started</H3>
    <p>Now back to your task of building a new site. This is a simple webpage landing area which you can replace using any code. Using Any Source Code Type including WIX, Microsoft Active Server Pages, PHP, Coldfusion Pages, Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla templates among others. Fusionshell allows you to link pages to a top and bottom navigation bar from any CMS tools, and we start with "Hardpoints" for major things that companies do. In addition we support several ecommerce fabrics including our own platform as a Shop. Fusion Commerce will be a paid add on option like FusionMobile to the OpenSource Tools which you can add later. Otherwise we recommend Wordpress with WooCommerce which is the world's most popular shop. They control more than 40% of the marketplace and perhaps higher. They are a plugin to WordpressV6+ which is now approaching a majority of public Internet websites with at least one instance.</p>
